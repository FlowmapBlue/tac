# Contributing to the TAC [DRAFT]

## Contributing Projects to UCF

If you're interested in contributing a project to the Urban Computing Foundation (UCF), please open up an issue here for discussion: https://github.com/ucfoundation/tac/issues

The full project proposal requirements is located [here](https://github.com/ucfoundation/tac/blob/master/PROJECT_LIFECYCLE.md#project-proposal-requirements).

## TAC Contributors

There has been a call from UCFâ€™s Technical Oversight Committee (TAC) for additional contributors and expertise to help evaluate potential projects and contribute to the UCF. The UCF TAC will refine how to get involved over time, however, here are some possible ways to contribute:

* Tech due diligence for projects
* Time spent helping projects
* Liaison with Governing Board
* UCF SIGs & working groups (various tasks)
* Technical content for website

If you are interested in engaging in this way, we would encourage you to issue a pull request to [TAC Contributors](https://github.com/ucfoundation/tac/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md) that you desire to become a TAC Contributor. Although there is not an actual limit of having one Contributor per company, we would encourage UCF member companies to designate an official TAC Contributor who is tasked with consulting internal experts and expressing a semi-official view on a given project.

This is not only about individual contribution.  It is also about rallying help from your employer, e.g., if you work for a UCF Member company. We're particularly interested in Contributors that can act as a focal point for tapping relevant expertise from their organizations and colleagues in order to engage with UCF discussions in a timely manner.

The TAC already has the pattern of encouraging non-members to make non-binding votes, so no change in the TAC charter is necessary to allow Contributors.

TAC [meetings](https://github.com/ucfoundation/tac/blob/master/README.md#communication) are only two hours a month, which are mainly taken up with project presentations. While Contributors are welcome to share their views during the meeting, the biggest opportunity is to comment on the TAC [mailing list](https://lists.uc.foundation/g/ucf-tac), on pull requests representing project applications and in voting.
