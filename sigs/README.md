# UCF Special Interest Groups ("SIGs")

The UCF TAC Special Interest Groups scale contributions by the UCF technical and user community, while retaining integrity and increasing quality in support of our mission.

TAC and TAC Contributors have fulfilled SIG duties in the past and will continue to do so until a specific SIG takes on that responsibility.
