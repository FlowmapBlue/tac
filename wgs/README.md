# UCF Working Groups ("WGs")

The UCF TAC Working Groups scale contributions by the UCF technical and user community, while retaining integrity and increasing quality in support of our mission.

TAC and TAC Contributors have fulfilled WG duties in the past and will continue to do so until a specific WG takes on that responsibility.

### Formation Process

@TODO

You will also have to present to the UCF TAC and wider community before your WG proposal will be voted upon by the TOC and community. You can request a presentation by filing an issue here: https://github.com/ucfoundation/tac/issues

At a minimum, please include this information:

* Goals
* Non-goals
* Mailing list information
* The location of meetings / agenda / notes
* Initial interested parties to show that there are multiple people across multiple orgs interested
* The chair(s) and TAC sponsor being explicitly listed so they are discoverable
