# Project Name

**Mapzen**

Request to move Mapzen from a standalone project with the Linux Foundation to the Urban Computing Foundation (under the Linux Foundation)

[Linux Foundation Project Announcement](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press-release/2019/01/mapzen-open-source-data-and-software-for-real-time-mapping-applications-to-become-a-linux-foundation-project/)

## Project description (what it does, why it is valuable, origin and history)

Mapzen is a collection of open-source projects focused on the core components of geo platforms, including search, rendering, navigation, and data. The goal is to provide high-quality, open alternatives for every major component of a mapping platform. Developed within Samsung from 2013-2017 and shut down in early 2018, Mapzen projects live on with the support of many companies and individual developers.

Mapzen is comprised of several independent projects managed by different communities and teams but under one umbrella. The major projects are:

- [Pelias](https://github.com/pelias/): distributed full-text geographic search engine
- [Tangram](https://github.com/tangrams/): libraries for rendering 2D & 3D maps with WebGL/OpenGL ES & vector tiles
- [Tilezen](https://github.com/tilezen/): libraries to generate vector tiles for global map display
- [Transitland](https://github.com/transitland/): community edited data service aggregating transit networks across metropolitan and rural areas around the world
- [Valhalla](https://github.com/valhalla/): global, multi-modal routing engine for turn-by-turn navigation services
- [Who's on First](https://github.com/whosonfirst-data/): gazetteer or big list of places, each with a stable identifier and descriptive properties

All above projects are currently under active development both sponsored by companies and volunteer time by individuals.

## Statement on alignment with Foundation charter's mission

The foundation charter's mission: "The mission of the Project is to enable widespread adoption and help accelerate development of open source urban computing and a surrounding ecosystem."

As a open mapping platform focused around search, display, and navigation, there is considerable overlap with the mission of the Urban Computing Foundation.
