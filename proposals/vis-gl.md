# vis.gl

This is a proposal to transfer vis.gl to the Urban Computing Foundation (UCF).

## Project description

vis.gl is a collection of frameworks designed for high-performance data visualization on the web. The libraries were originally open-sourced by Uber as early as 2016. Today, they are widely used by tech companies, research institutions and policymakers in geospatial analysis, robotics, and machine learning.

- `deck.gl` - WebGL-powered visualization framework for large-scale data sets
- `loaders.gl` - Framework-agnostic loaders and writers for common data formats
- `luma.gl` - Low-level WebGL2 wrapper
- `react-map-gl` - Basemap components

One project of the vis.gl family, `kepler.gl`, was donated to UCF in 2019. `kepler.gl` is built on top of all the above frameworks.


## Statement on alignment with Foundation charter's mission

The UCF charter's mission statement: "The mission of the Project is to enable widespread adoption and help accelerate development of open source urban computing and a surrounding ecosystem."

vis.gl makes it easy to create applications that display and interact with dynamic large data sets. It is specially optimized for geospatial data and is integrated with major base map providers including Mapbox, Google Maps, and ArcGIS. It is among the most comprehensive open-source solutions for building GIS applications on the Web. It is already adopted by organizations that work in the urban computing domain, including Uber, Microsoft, Google, Stanford, UNICEF, and the U.S. Department of Transportation. It is widely used to visualize information that is vital to the study of urban environments, such as urban planning, transportation, economy, communication, as well as the machine learning and simulation models in this space.

- Victor Powell (Tesla)


## Briefly describe the project's leadership team and decision-making process

The current leadership team of vis.gl:

- Tarek Sherif (Uber) - current tech lead at Uber Visualization
- Xiaoji Chen (Microsoft) - former tech lead at Uber Visualization
- Ib Green (Unfolded) - the original architect of vis.gl

Additional core contributors come from Uber, Google, Carto, and ESRI.

If vis.gl is accepted into the UCF, we plan to form the initial steering committee (TSC) around the existing technical leads. The TSC's task is to provide technical guidance for feature development as well as grooming new project maintainers.

The TSC and core contributors will meet regularly to decide on the next roadmap of vis.gl. All feature planning are consensus-based and documented on GitHub. See the governance guideline below for details.
